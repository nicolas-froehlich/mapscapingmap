    "To introduce a jitter of approximately 1 kilometer to the locations in your interviewees table to ensure that identical locations don’t overlay each other, you can use the ST_Translate function in PostGIS. This function shifts the geometry by a specified amount in the x (longitude) and y (latitude) directions. The amount to shift can be determined based on the degree equivalent of the desired distance at the given latitude (keeping in mind that a degree of longitude varies in actual distance depending on the latitude, but for small distances like 1km, this can be approximated fairly accurately).\n",

Given that 1 degree of latitude is approximately 111 kilometers, a shift of about 0.009° in any direction would approximate to 1 kilometer. For longitude, this value needs to be adjusted based on the latitude due to the varying distance covered by a degree of longitude, but for simplicity, we'll use the same approximation, which is reasonable for small distances and near the equator.\n",
