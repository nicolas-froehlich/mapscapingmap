    "To introduce a jitter of approximately 1 kilometer to the locations in your interviewees table to ensure that identical locations don’t overlay each other, you can use the ST_Translate function in PostGIS. This function shifts the geometry by a specified amount in the x (longitude) and y (latitude) directions. The amount to shift can be determined based on the degree equivalent of the desired distance at the given latitude (keeping in mind that a degree of longitude varies in actual distance depending on the latitude, but for small distances like 1km, this can be approximated fairly accurately).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the jitter, we can use random offsets in both the latitude and longitude directions. Given that 1 degree of latitude is approximately 111 kilometers, a shift of about 0.009° in any direction would approximate to 1 kilometer. For longitude, this value needs to be adjusted based on the latitude due to the varying distance covered by a degree of longitude, but for simplicity, we'll use the same approximation, which is reasonable for small distances and near the equator.\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL statement will move each point in a random direction by up to approximately 1 kilometer. The RANDOM() function generates a value between 0 and 1, so RANDOM() * 0.018 - 0.009 will produce a shift ranging from -0.009° to +0.009° in both latitude and longitude, effectively creating a jitter around the original point."
