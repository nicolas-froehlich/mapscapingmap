This is the code for creating a map that shows locations and additional information about all of Daniel's interview partners in the [MapScaping](https://mapscaping.com/) podcast. 🗺️ 🌐 🎙️


Code for replicating the scraping, cleaning, and geocoding of the data can be found in the MapScapingMap.ipynb Python notebook.
I tried out two alternative ways of displaying the data on a publishable map. The more complex one is based on JS Angular, the simpler one is based on R Shiny.

Enjoy browsing through MapScaping's interview partners :)
